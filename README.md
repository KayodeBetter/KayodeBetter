Hello everyone,

I was currently accepted into The Cloud Native Computing Foundation "Zero to merge" Open source program with other bright minds from around the world. 

So far I have learnt a lot and am excited as to what's still to come in my open source journey. 

Apart from open source I love travelling round the world by watching videos documentry and films as this helps me learn about other cultures. I also love visiting 
the beach and the feel of the fresh wind on my face.

You can connect with me via [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kayode-better)
